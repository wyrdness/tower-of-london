      "full": "The **Tower of London** is a historic castle on the north bank of the River Thames in central London, England. Founded in 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest, the Tower has served as royal residence, fortress, prison, place of execution, armory, treasury, menagerie, and home of the Crown Jewels. With nearly a thousand years of dark history—including countless executions, murders, tortures, and imprisonments—the Tower is considered one of the most haunted locations in Britain, if not the world. The fortress complex comprises the White Tower (the original Norman keep built by William the Conqueror), multiple towers, walls, and buildings added over centuries. The most famous paranormal phenomena include the ghost of Anne Boleyn (executed 1536), the Princes in the Tower (murdered 1483), and numerous other spectral figures associated with the Tower's grim past. Guards, staff, and visitors have reported apparitions, unexplained sounds, phantom smells, cold spots, and overwhelming feelings of dread in various locations throughout the complex. As a UNESCO World Heritage Site attracting over 2.7 million visitors annually, the Tower of London combines genuine historical significance with compelling ghost stories. Whether one believes in the paranormal or not, the weight of history—the centuries of human suffering, political intrigue, and violent death—creates an atmosphere unlike any other historical site in the world."
